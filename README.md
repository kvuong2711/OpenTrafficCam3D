## Responsive Webpage Template

This project webpage template is mobile responsive! Resizing the webpage will automatically
shift elements around to fit the screen. Try a live version
[here](https://jasonyzhang.com/webpage-template).

This webpage template is a fork of
[this widely used project webpage template](https://github.com/richzhang/webpage-template)
by [Richard Zhang](https://richzhang.github.io). This template was originally made for
[this colorful paper](http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/). The responsive version
was made for [this paper](https://jasonyzhang.com/phosa/).

To use this template, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/jasonyzhang/webpage-template
```

Copy the contents into a `gh-pages` branch of a GitHub repo. That will automatically 
make a webpage under address [GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME](GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME).
